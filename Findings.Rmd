## Findings

In conclusion, the scatterplot of square footage vs sale price in Manhattan shows inconclusive results. Variables such as neighborhood and year the housing was built is affecting the the outcome of the results and producing a non-linear graph

Further analysis will be needed to reclassify the sale price and square footage by neighborhood to get more meaningful results
